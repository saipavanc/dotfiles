# TODO
- Maybe get popup menus to work on the widgets in status containers
- Add switchable sub-panels in the side-panel like in AGS. 
- popup menu for a window, to be able to switch to a different workspace (not too important)
- Look for signals for monitor change and add or remove panels as needed.

## Power settings
    - Add battery percentage, and memory usage as labels to the status container on the status bar.
    - Hypridle, connect to hypridle 
    - see if I can make a gtk window with power settings, need an interface to set the necessary power settings
    - Sleep inhibitor button in side-panel
